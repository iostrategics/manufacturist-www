                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After graduating university with a degree in aerospace engineering, I took the
                            unconventional
                            route and started a business in the United States.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We helped B2B companies build complex e-commerce websites that integrated with backend
                            systems
                            like inventory and ERP.
                            With digital sales tools and better information to work with, our clients were able to
                            unlock
                            revenue potential and make more effective decisions about where to invest their resources.
                        </p>
                        <!-- <p>
                            Eventually I decided to travel the world for a few years before settling in Europe, where
                            I've now commited to building custom software and commercial products that help
                            manufacturers
                            stay competitive through the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
                        </p> -->
                        <p>
                            As an engineer, I'm obsessed with solving problems. And the biggest problem I see today is
                            that smaller manufacturing businesses are increasingly unable to compete because
                            technology has historically been
                            too expensive, complicated, and disruptive to bother with.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So that's why I started Manufacturist &mdash; a podcast and free educational
                            resource to help
                            small manufacturers adopt simple, low-cost digital tools that make them more productive with
                            immediate
                            payoff.
                        </p>
